       <h2>WHAT IS AI ?</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables machines to think, learn, 
      and make decisions similar humans. They cant truly think, but they prescribe actions 
      based on data and algorithms. Basically, they are robotic systems created by humans 
      to learn patterns, make predictions, and automate tasks.
